# Sudoku Solver Computer Vision

## Getting Started 
In this project, I'm interested in using computer vision principles to solve a sudoku puzzle using OpenCV and augmented reality techniques. The final project goal is to solve a sudoku puzzle game in a given image. The input will be an image that includes a sudoku board, and the output will be an image that contains the sudoku solution.

## Basic Steps
The implementation follows:
1.	Image Processing: \
    a.	Detect contours and object localization, finding the sudoku board contours. \
    b.	Sudoku board extraction for a straight plain shape image. \
    c.	Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and digit classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
2.	Sudoku Solver:
    a.	Sudoku matrix creation according to the OCR operation. \
    b.	Sudoku solver algorithm that performs the sudoku matrix solution.
3.	A Straight Plain Image Result Creation (Image Processing): \
    a.	Localize the solutionâ€™s digits onto the straight plain image.
4.	Augmented Reality: \
    a.	Merge/overlay the solution result upon the original image.
    
## Computer Vision Methods
* Image features (image processing), including smoothing images using a Gaussian kernel for noise reduction, scaling and adapted threshold images, and image operations (add, multiply, etc.).
* Object detection, mostly for obtaining the sudoku board contours (also, has been used for digit detection within the cell's image.) from a binary image using the algorithm of Suzuki & Be.
* Geometry, including transformation matrix computation (intrinsic Parameters) and warping image processes such as generating the straight plain image, etc. 
* Object recognition & CNN, mostly for the optical character recognition (OCR) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for handwritten digits classification.
* Homography, including the homography matrix computation. It mostly has been used for augmented reality (AR) techniques.


## Installing
